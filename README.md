**How to upload new stuff (if there is no existing folder for your topic, otherwise just jump to step 7):**

2. click on "create a new file" in the folder
3. name the file (this will show up on the top where you see the file path) name-of-topic/ReadMe.md -> this will create a new folder for your specific topic and a ReadMe file
4. write a short description in the ReadMe file, e.g. this is a presentation about how to clean your room in undere 2 hours and a short code example
5. (if you want to make it even better then add the references you used for this in the ReadMe file)
6. click on commit changes and voila you have created a folder for your specific topic
7. click on upload file within the folder and drag-and-drop the files you want to upload (**please convert powerpoint files into pdfs**)
